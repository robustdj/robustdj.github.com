You can list tags by running this:

```
git tag
```

Suppose we see a tag called v1.0.1 that we want to remove. Weâ€™d simply remove it like this:

```
git tag -d v1.0.1
git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.1
```

The first line will remove the tag locally and the second line will remove the remote tag.
